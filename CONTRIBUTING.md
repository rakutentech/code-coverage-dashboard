# Contributing

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Coding Guidelines

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more unit tests/specs
- All public API methods must be documented and potentially also described in the user guide.


## Pull Requests

1. Fork the project
2. Implement feature/xxx & add test cases
3. Ensure test cases & static analysis runs succesfully
4. Submit a pull request to develop branch

**NOTE:** When submitting a pull request, *please make sure to target the `develop` branch*, so that your changes are up-to-date and easy to integrate with the most recent work on the buildpack. Thanks!
